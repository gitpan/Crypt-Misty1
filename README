Crypt::Misty1
=============

Misty1 is a 128-bit key, 64-bit block cipher. Designed by Mitsuru
Matsui, the inventor of linear cryptanalysis, Misty1 is the first
cipher that is provably secure against linear and differential
cryptanalysis.

In January of 2000, the 3GPP consortium selected a variant of Misty1,
dubbed as KASUMI (the Japanese word for ``misty''), as the mandatory
cipher in W-CDMA.
